Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect fake news articles using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model analyzes the textual content of news articles and predicts whether the information is real or fake.

The project uses a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text data into numerical form and a Logistic Regression classifier (or Naive Bayes) for binary classification. The dataset consists of labeled news articles with realistic reporting patterns and misleading or fabricated stories.

A clean and interactive Gradio interface has been built for real-time testing. Users can paste any news headline or paragraph, and the system will return a prediction with a confidence score, visually represented in color-coded blocks (ðŸŸ© Real, ðŸŸ¥ Fake).
